# Sales.Analysis in this project I analyze the mall cutomer data using python and answer a few questions;
1) Which city had the highest number of sales?
2) What time should we display the advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
3) What products are most often sold together?
4) What product sold the most and why?
